# Heart Attack Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the risk of heart attack using machine learning techniques applied to real-world clinical data.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Decision Tree Classifier

## 📁 Project Files
- `heart.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data analysis and modeling steps
- `Heart.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation
- `hearttree.png`: Visualization of the decision tree model
- `Heart.zip`: Zipped version of the project for easy sharing
- `.ipynb_checkpoints`: Auto-saved backup files by Jupyter Notebook (ignored in Git)

## 📊 Project Overview
The notebook walks through a basic machine learning pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
